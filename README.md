## Project Description
1. Questions to study
2.  Approach

## Project Outline

1.  Data Inputs
- further focus data types and sets from data sources below
2.  Data Prep and Inital Analysis
- possible ML algorithms for clustering within this seciton
3. Data Viz from previous
4.  Test vs Scoring Data Set Choices
5.  Modeling
6.  Scoreing Model
7. Evaluation of Models
8. Reporting



## Notes to lead to Outline
- Sort through RAM data sets
- Decide on variables
    - predator prey?
- Do we want to poll species
  -  use K-means clustering as its own possibility for relationshops between datasets
  (other clustering algs: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-clustering-algorithms-data-scientists-need-to-know-a36d136ef68)
  - look for shared trends
- Environmental Data
  - how to use
- Time Series issues:
  - https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-supervised-learning/
  - use a step to cluster time series such as Kendall Seasonal trend analysis or similar

- analysis and clean choice data sets
- develop multiple models
    - one for data pooling
    - for comaprisons
    - for recruitment forecasting



## Project TODO's and milestones

## Data sources
